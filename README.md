Shinobi CCTV Home Assistant Integration

## Closed ##

I am no longer maintaining this project, instead I reccomend using this project, which already is available from within HACS.

[Shinobi Video NVR](https://github.com/elad-bar/ha-shinobi)

## How it works

This custom component adds a support for Shinobi CCTV monitors to show up as camera entities in home assistant.

## Installation

### HACS

Requirements:

- HACS version 0.9 or higher

  Add this repo as a custom repository [integration] in hacs and install

### Manual

copy the entire ha_shinobicctv folder in custom_components into the config/custom_components folder on your installation, reboot, and the integration should be available to add from the intrgrations page.

## Usage
